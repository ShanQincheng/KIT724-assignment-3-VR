# KIT724-Assignment-3-VR-Application-Development

## Introduction

![](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzEzNDk0NzQ2LmpwZw==/original/I8fJy9.jpg)

This application focuses on the Fear/Phobia theme for the VR application assignment. Players will encounter their most feared things face to face in a medieval room and use a magical wand to transform the feared object into something amusing. This idea is inspired by the fantastic novel Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (J. K. Rowling, 1999). It is hoped that it can bring less pressure and more pleasure to players, meeting the requirements of low-level exposure therapy.

## Description

### What the application does

This application aims to help players reduce their extreme or irrational fear of something. In this application's scene, players are free to choose their comfortable time to face their feared object by holding up the magic wand in their hand. The object of their fear can vanish immediately when players want to stop it, by dropping the magic wand. If players still have the courage to face their fear, they can go further to transform the object into something amusing by pressing the button on the Oculus Quest controller.

### What is the significance of your application in the context of your chosen scenario

* Provide players a place to face their extreme fears, helping them reduce their fearful feelings.
* Offer Harry Potter fans a new way to overcome their fears, just like how Harry Potter did in the books and movies.
* Ensure control over how the feared object performs, for example, not walking too close to the player.
* The application provides a safe environment for players. In the worst case, if players can't bear it anymore, they can quit immediately without any physical harm.
* The application can be deployed for the next player or replay the scene for the current player immediately.

### What is the significance of the interface technology (VR) in the context of the application

* VR provides a computer-generated world with which the user can interact, offering multiple sensorial channels (vision, sound, touch, smell, taste) (BURDEA & COIFFET, 2003). We need to place players in a real-time simulation world to face their fears and provide them with interaction abilities to start, stop, and complete the challenge. In this case, VR technology has all the advantages we need.
* Head-Mounted VR usually features stereoscopic displays and tracking systems, enabling users to see stereoscopic images through a wide field of vision and have the virtual camera move according to the user’s head position (Boas, 2013). In our application, users will have the ability to move their position and vision; Head-Mounted VR has this technology implemented.
* VR is a very valuable instructional and practice alternative when the real thing is hazardous to learners, instructors, equipment, or the environment (Okechukwu & Udoka, 2011). The things that players fear can be various, and some of them could be hazardous. A realistic environment could accidentally hurt players when they encounter their feared object and lose their mind trying to stay away. In this case, VR technology provides good protection for players.

## Interaction Design

### Why the interaction(s) are needed in the application.

Players will have the ability to control the application process. They will interact with the application, allowing their feared object to enter the scene when they are ready, stop the game immediately if they can't bear it anymore, or continue to transform the object into something amusing if they still face it.

## Technical Development

### Specific interface technology used

Oculus Quest

### How to engage with available interaction(s)

#### Walk around the scene

You can navigate through the scene by either moving the joysticks up/down, left/right on the Meta Quest controllers or by physically walking.

#### Grab the magic wand

To grab the magic wand, position your hand next to it and hold in the trigger on the Meta Quest controller.

#### Stop the fearing thing out of scene

To remove the frightening object and stop the game immediately, release the trigger on the Meta Quest controllers, i.e., drop the magic wand.

#### Transform fearing thing into somthing amusing

While holding the magic wand, press the X/Y button on the Meta Quest left controller to transform the frightening object into something amusing.

## Descriptions of 3D Models

### Free Medieval Room

I used it to create a vintage environment for players; its style resembles the classrooms in Harry Potter movies, giving players a space to face their fears directly and relatively closely.

### 3D Items - Free Wand Pack

![](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzEzNDk0NzcxLnBuZw==/original/Q8QSj8.png)

I used it to represent a magic wand, similar to those used by wizards in Harry Potter movies, but it doesn't look identical.

### PBR_Orc-Pig

After players press the button on the Quest Controller and transform their feared object into something amusing, this is used to represent it.

### Fantasy Spider

I use it to render players' feared objects.
